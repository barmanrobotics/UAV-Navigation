add these two lines after making your virtual environment in the bashrc file

pass this command to enter the bashrc

nano ~/.bashrc

Go to the end of the file and paste these two line replacing your virtual-environment name and file path.

For my system, the virtual environment name was my-venv.

alias my-venv="source /home/saintarnab/my-venv/bin/activate

now if you type my-venv in a fresh terminal it should activate your virtual environment

I also exported the path of mavproxy to the bashrc file to directly call it from my virtual environment rather than going inside the folder

export PATH=$PATH:/home/saintarnab/my-venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/MAVProxy

now I can call mavproxy.py inside my virtual environment directly

use command mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyAMA0 to connect to the copter at the default baudrate of 57600
